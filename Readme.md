# Truly RYX -- DO NOT confuse Pseudoryx!
## What is this?

Truly RYX is yet another parser generator.

The LL(1) class has limited representability.
But if a grammar has completely been wrote in the LL(1) class,
that is easy to say the grammar is simple.

Truly RYX accepts a grammar if the grammar is in the LL(1).
