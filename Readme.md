# Truly RYX -- DO NOT confuse Pseudoryx!
## What is this?

Truly RYX is yet another parser generator.

## Why useful?

The LL(1) class has limited representability.
But if a grammar has completely been wrote in the LL(1) class,
that is easy to say the grammar is simple.

Truly RYX accepts a grammar if the grammar is in the LL(1).

## Get Started

```bash
$ git clone git://github.com/pixie-grasper/ryx.git
$ cd ryx
$ make
```

## TODO

- Generate codes
  - It has ability to syntax-check only now.
